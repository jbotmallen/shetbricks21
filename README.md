**MallenCode** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because it is my main Github page where most of my projects are found. <br>
⛰️ It is a **journey** documented through the code I publish! ⛰️

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **a personal project called <a href="#">Scopify</a>**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **NextJs 14 and building a full-stack e-commerce website**
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **NextJs configurations, setups, and project structure.**
- 💬 Ask me about **C-programming and Javascript questions.**
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him. Respecting is key but I generally don't mind being misgendered.**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I enrolled for Engineering courses but stuck with my passion for coding!**
